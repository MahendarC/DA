Web scraping involves a structured process to extract data from websites systematically and ethically. 
Here's a full breakdown of the procedures you should follow, step-by-step:

✅ 1. Define Your Goal
Clearly answer:
          ->What data do you need?
          ->Which websites will you scrape?
          ->How will the data be used?

🔍 Example: “Scrape rental listings from 99acres.com including title, location, price, and area.”

✅ 2. Inspect the Website
        ->Open the target site and:
        ->Use Developer Tools (Right-click → Inspect Element or F12)
        ->Find the structure of the HTML containing the data
        ->Check for:
                ->Tags (<div>, <span>, <a>)
                ->class or id attributes
                ->Pagination logic
                ->Dynamic loading (JavaScript)

✅ 3. Choose Scraping Tools
Pick tools based on the site's complexity:

Site Type            	               Tool
Static HTML        	          requests, BeautifulSoup
JavaScript-Rendered	          Selenium, Playwright
Large scale or API use       	Scrapy, aiohttp


✅ 4. Make an HTTP Request
Use requests to load static pages:

                                              import requests
                                              from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
                                              
                                              url = 'https://example.com/page1'
                                              response = requests.get(url)
                                              soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')


✅ 5. Parse the HTML
Extract data using tags, classes, or IDs:

                                              titles = soup.find_all('div', class_='property-title')
                                              for title in titles:
                                                  print(title.text.strip())


✅ 6. Handle Pagination
Loop through multiple pages by changing the page number in the URL:

                                              for page in range(1, 6):
                                                  url = f'https://example.com/page={page}'
                                                  response = requests.get(url)
                                                  # parse as usual


✅ 7. Handle Dynamic Content
Use Selenium if data appears after the page loads:

                                              from selenium import webdriver
                                              
                                              driver = webdriver.Chrome()
                                              driver.get('https://example.com')
                                              html = driver.page_source
                                              soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')


✅ 8. Store the Extracted Data
Save your results to a CSV, Excel, or database:

                                              import pandas as pd
                                              
                                              data = {'Title': titles, 'Price': prices}
                                              df = pd.DataFrame(data)
                                              df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)


✅ 9. Respect Robots.txt and Site Policies
Always:
->Check https://example.com/robots.txt
->Avoid scraping if disallowed
->Limit request rate using time.sleep()
->Use headers to mimic browsers:

                                              headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}
                                              requests.get(url, headers=headers)


✅ 10. Add Error Handling & Logging
Improve robustness with:

                                    import time
                                    import logging
                                    
                                    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
                                    try:
                                        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
                                        response.raise_for_status()
                                    except Exception as e:
                                        logging.error(f"Failed to fetch {url}: {e}")
                                        time.sleep(5)
